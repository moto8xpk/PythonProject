You can verify that Python 3 is installed on your system by running:

## python3 -V

Starting from Python 3.6, the recommended way to create a virtual environment is to use the venv module.

Let’s start by installing the python3-venv package that provides the venv module.

## sudo apt install python3-venv

Once the module is installed we are ready to create virtual environments for Python 3.

First switch to a directory where you would like to store your Python 3 virtual environments. Within the directory run the following command to create your new virtual environment:

## python3 -m venv my-project-env

The command above creates a directory called my-project-env, which contains a copy of the Python binary, the Pip package manager, the standard Python library and other supporting files.

To start using this virtual environment, you need to activate it by running the activate script:

## source my-project-env/bin/activate

Once activated, the virtual environment’s bin directory will be added at the beginning of the $PATH variable. Also your shell’s prompt will change and it will show the name of the virtual environment you’re currently using. In our case that is my-project-env:

if i want to downgrade the python version from 3.7 to 3.6 i should have a few steps

install python 3.6

## apt install python3.6

set for new variable env:

## alias pip3.6="python3.6 -m pip"
